# chit-chatwme

To start a video chat, a user types a room name and clicks join. If another person wants to join the same chat, they need to type in the exact same room name. Once both are in the same room, the app connects them using WebRTC, asking for camera and microphone access. After that, they can see and hear each other in real time. If no one else joins the room, the first user just waits until someone enters with the same name.
